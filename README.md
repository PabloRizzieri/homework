## Implementing JAXB Annotations for XML Processing

This homework task involves enhancing the existing hierarchy by incorporating JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) annotations. Specifically, annotate the hierarchy's classes, ensuring coverage for Date, List, and complex objects. Additionally, parse XML data using JAXB annotations to map the XML representation to Java objects.

### Task Overview

1. **JAXB Annotations Addition**: Apply JAXB annotations to classes within the hierarchy, covering Date, List, and complex objects for XML mapping.
2. **Annotation Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of annotations, accurately representing XML elements and attributes in Java classes.
3. **XML Parsing using JAXB**: Parse XML data by utilizing JAXB annotations to map XML representations to corresponding Java objects.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **JAXB Annotation Integration**: Introduce JAXB annotations (such as `@XmlRootElement`, `@XmlElement`, `@XmlAttribute`, etc.) to appropriate classes within the hierarchy.
2. **Date, List, and Complex Object Annotation**: Annotate fields or properties representing Date types, List structures, and complex objects with JAXB annotations.
3. **XML Parsing via JAXB**: Implement JAXB parsing functionality to convert XML data into corresponding Java objects using the annotated classes.
