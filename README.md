Sure, here's a comprehensive README with instructions for both tasks, emphasizing the implementation of Bubble Sort for the second task:

# Programming Exercises

This repository contains two programming exercises:

1. **User Info App:** Create a simple system.out app that prints information about the user passed as a parameter to the main function.

2. **Sorting Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm from the list of sorting algorithms: Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, or Quicksort.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured

### Task 1: User Info App

1. Create a Java file named `UserInfoApp.java`.

2. Implement the `main()` method that takes a string array of user information as a parameter.

3. Parse the user information and print it to the console using `System.out.println()`.
  
4. Run the compiled class file using `java path/UserInfo John Doe 30 Developer` replacing the example argument with actual user information.

### Task 2: Bubble Sort Implementation

1. Create a Java file named `BubbleSort.java`.

2. Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm as a method.

3. Create a `main()` method to test the Bubble Sort algorithm.

4. Run the compiled class file using `java path/BubbleSort`.
