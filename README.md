## Collection Streaming and Reflection in Java

This homework assignment involves implementing 7 collection streaming operations with terminal and non-terminal operations. Additionally, utilize reflection to extract information about fields, constructors, and methods, and demonstrate object creation and method invocation solely through reflection.

### Task Overview

1. **Collection Streaming**: Implement 7 streaming operations within the collection hierarchy, showcasing both terminal and non-terminal operations.
2. **Reflection Usage**: Utilize reflection to extract information about fields, constructors, and methods from a class. Create an object and invoke a method using reflection.

### Additional Information

- **Collection Streaming**: Use the Stream API to perform various operations on collections, including filtering, mapping, reducing, etc. Showcase both intermediate and terminal operations.
- **Reflection**: Reflection provides a means to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, constructors, and methods at runtime. Extract metadata and dynamically access these elements using reflection.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Collection Streaming Operations**: Implement 7 different operations using the Stream API on collections. Include a mix of terminal and non-terminal operations to demonstrate their functionalities.
2. **Reflection Information Extraction**: Use reflection to gather details about fields, constructors, and methods of a particular class.
3. **Object Creation and Method Invocation via Reflection**: Dynamically create an object of a class and invoke a method solely using reflection techniques.
