## Implementing SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

This homework task involves the integration of SOLID principles and various Design Patterns into your existing project. The primary goals include the incorporation of Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Listener, Facade, Decorator, Proxy, Strategy, and MVC patterns into the project. Additionally, the existing code should be refactored to adhere to SOLID principles.

### Task Overview

1. **Design Pattern Integration**:
    - Implement Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Listener, Facade, Decorator, Proxy, Strategy, and MVC patterns into your current project.
    - Each pattern should be applied where it fits naturally within the existing project structure.

2. **SOLID Principles Refactoring**:
    - Refactor the current codebase to align with the SOLID principles.
    - Focus on Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Pattern Integration**:
    - Identify suitable scenarios within your current project for each of the specified design patterns.
    - Apply patterns judiciously to enhance project structure, maintainability, and flexibility.

2. **SOLID Principles Refactoring**:
    - Evaluate existing code and refactor as needed to adhere to SOLID principles.
    - Strive for modular, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable code.

### Considerations

- **Pattern Applicability**: Choose appropriate scenarios for each design pattern, ensuring they contribute positively to the project's architecture.
- **SOLID Principles Adherence**: Refactor the code with careful consideration of SOLID principles, focusing on improving code quality and maintainability.
