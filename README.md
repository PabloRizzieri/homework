## Java Lambda Functions and Complex Enums

This homework assignment encompasses the use of lambda functions from the `java.util.function` package, creation of custom lambda functions with generics, and the implementation of complex enums with fields, methods, and blocks.

### Task Overview

1. **Lambda Functions**: Utilize at least 5 lambda functions from the `java.util.function` package in your implementation.
2. **Custom Lambda Functions with Generics**: Develop 3 custom lambda functions incorporating generics to enhance flexibility and reusability.
3. **Complex Enums**: Create 5 enums with multiple fields, methods, and initialization blocks to represent diverse functionalities.

### Additional Information

- **Lambda Functions**: Lambda functions provide a concise way to express behaviors or functionalities. Utilize common interfaces from the `java.util.function` package such as `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, etc.
- **Custom Lambda Functions**: Customize lambda functions by incorporating generics to enable parameterization and increased flexibility.
- **Complex Enums**: Enums are used to represent a fixed set of constants. Create complex enums with additional fields, methods, and initialization blocks to demonstrate their versatility.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Lambda Functions Usage**: Explore various functional interfaces from `java.util.function` like `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, etc., and implement them in your code.
2. **Custom Lambda Functions**: Develop custom lambda functions with generics to solve specific tasks or operations, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
3. **Complex Enums Creation**: Design enums with multiple fields, methods, and initialization blocks to demonstrate their capabilities beyond simple constant values.
