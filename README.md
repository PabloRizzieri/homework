## Database Schema Creation using MySQL Workbench

This homework involves creating a comprehensive database schema using MySQL Workbench for a new hierarchy, comprising at least 12 tables with all relations. The schema must adhere to the three Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) for effective data organization and reduction of data redundancy.

### Task Overview

1. **Database Schema Creation**: Design and implement a database schema using MySQL Workbench, consisting of a minimum of 12 tables representing entities and their relationships.
2. **Normalization**: Ensure the schema satisfies the three Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to eliminate data redundancy and maintain data integrity.
3. **Entity Relationships**: Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys to represent the connections between different entities within the database.

### Additional Information

- **Database Design**: Employ MySQL Workbench to visually design and create the database schema with proper tables, columns, and relationships.
- **Normalization Rules**: Apply normalization rules to organize data efficiently, minimize redundancy, and avoid update anomalies.
- **Relationship Establishment**: Define appropriate relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) using foreign key constraints.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Table Creation**: Create tables representing different entities within the hierarchy, defining columns and primary keys.
2. **Relationship Establishment**: Establish relationships between tables by defining foreign keys referencing primary keys in related tables.
3. **Normalization Check**: Verify that the schema design adheres to the three Normal Forms, ensuring proper data organization and integrity.
