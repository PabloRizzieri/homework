## Implementing JSON Processing with Jackson Annotations

This homework task focuses on JSON processing using the Jackson library. The objective is to create a JSON file representing data for a minimum of 5 classes from the provided hierarchy. Additionally, integrate Jackson annotations into the hierarchy's classes, ensuring coverage for Date, List, and complex objects. Finally, parse the JSON file using Jackson annotations to map the JSON representation to Java objects.

### Task Overview

1. **JSON File Creation**: Generate a JSON file containing data for at least 5 classes from the given hierarchy.
2. **Jackson Annotation Integration**: Add Jackson annotations to the hierarchy's classes, covering Date, List, and complex objects for accurate JSON mapping.
3. **Annotation Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of Jackson annotations to accurately represent JSON elements and structures in Java classes.
4. **JSON Parsing using Jackson**: Parse the JSON file utilizing Jackson annotations to map JSON data to corresponding Java objects.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **JSON File Structure**: Design the JSON file structure to encompass data related to the specified 5 classes from the given hierarchy.
2. **Jackson Annotation Integration**: Apply Jackson annotations (`@JsonProperty`, `@JsonFormat`, `@JsonManagedReference`, etc.) to appropriate fields or properties in the hierarchy's classes.
3. **Date, List, and Complex Object Annotation**: Annotate fields or properties representing Date types, List structures, and complex objects accurately with Jackson annotations.
4. **JSON Parsing Execution**: Implement Jackson parsing functionality to convert JSON data into corresponding Java objects using the annotated classes.
