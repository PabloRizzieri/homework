## XML Parsing, XSD Schemas, and Validation

This homework focuses on working with XML files, employing default parsers like Stax, SAX, and DOM, along with XSD schemas. The task involves creating an XML file and corresponding XSD schema for a minimum of 5 classes from the provided hierarchy. Furthermore, the XML file must be validated using the XSD schema and an assigned parser. Lastly, the XML file needs to be parsed using one of the specified parsers.

### Task Overview

1. **XML File Creation**: Generate an XML file representing data for at least 5 classes from the given hierarchy.
2. **XSD Schema Development**: Create an XSD schema that defines the structure and constraints for validating the generated XML file.
3. **XML Validation**: Validate the XML file against the XSD schema using the specified parser.
4. **XML Parsing**: Parse the validated XML file using one of the default parsers: Stax, SAX, or DOM.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **XML File Structure**: Design the XML file structure to encompass data related to the provided hierarchy's 5 classes.
2. **XSD Schema Definition**: Develop an XSD schema that accurately describes the structure and constraints of the XML file.
3. **XML Validation Process**: Validate the generated XML file against the XSD schema using the assigned parser (Stax, SAX, or DOM).
4. **XML Parsing Execution**: Choose and implement one of the default parsers to parse the validated XML file.

### Considerations

- **Hierarchy Representation**: Ensure the XML file comprehensively represents data for the specified 5 classes from the given hierarchy.
- **XSD Schema Accuracy**: Create an XSD schema that precisely defines the structure and constraints of the XML data.
- **Validation and Parsing Accuracy**: Perform accurate validation and parsing of the XML file using the designated parser, ensuring correctness and adherence to the XSD schema.
