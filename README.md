## Maven Project Configuration and Usage

This homework involves transitioning existing projects to Maven, building a JAR file, deploying it to the local repository, incorporating plugins, and running different Maven phases to observe their outcomes.

### Requirements

1. **Maven Migration**: Move all existing projects to the Maven build system.
2. **JAR File Creation**: Build a JAR file for the project and deploy it to the local repository.
3. **Plugins Integration**: Include at least 2 plugins in the Maven configuration.
4. **Maven Lifecycle Phases**: Execute the `mvn` command for various phases of the Maven lifecycle and examine the resulting outcomes.

### Maven Project Configuration

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. This assignment requires migrating existing projects to Maven, which involves configuring the `pom.xml` files, defining dependencies, and structuring the project according to Maven conventions.

### JAR File Creation and Repository Deployment

Creating a JAR file using Maven is a fundamental aspect of the build process. Additionally, deploying this JAR to the local repository makes it accessible for other projects within the same environment.

### Plugins Integration

Plugins extend the functionality of Maven by providing additional capabilities. Incorporating at least 2 plugins into the Maven configuration will offer hands-on experience with extending Maven's capabilities beyond its default behavior.

### Maven Lifecycle Phases

The Maven lifecycle consists of various phases, and executing the `mvn` command for different phases provides insights into the sequence of actions and processes that Maven performs during a build.
