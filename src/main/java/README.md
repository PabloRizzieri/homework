## Exception Handling and Logging

This homework focuses on the implementation of exception handling and logging mechanisms in Java.

### Requirements

1. **Custom Exceptions**: Create 5 custom exceptions tailored to specific error scenarios.
2. **Exception Handling**: Implement exception handling in 2 different ways.
3. **Try-Catch with Resources**: Utilize the try-catch with resources construct to handle exceptions.
4. **Logging**: Log messages to both the console and a file for effective error tracking and debugging.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that unexpected errors are gracefully managed and appropriately communicated to the user and developer.

The following components are key to this assignment:

- **Try-Catch-Finally Block**: Employ the try-catch-finally block to handle exceptions and ensure proper resource management.
- **Throw and Throws**: Implement the `throw` and `throws` keywords to propagate and handle exceptions effectively.

### Logging

Logging is essential for tracking errors and understanding the flow of the program during its execution. By logging messages to both the console and a file, developers can monitor the application's behavior and identify any issues that may arise during runtime.
