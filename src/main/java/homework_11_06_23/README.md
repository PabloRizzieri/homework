## Extended Features: Interfaces, Final (class, method, variable), Static, Polymorphism

This extended version of the homework incorporates additional features and requirements into the existing structure.

### Requirements

1. **Interfaces**: Add 5 interfaces to the existing hierarchy.
2. **Polymorphism**: Utilize polymorphism with the abstract class and interface from the hierarchy.
3. **Final**: Create a final class, method, and variable.
4. **Static**: Implement a static block, method, and variable.

### Previous Homework Overview

The previous version of the homework included the following features:

- Utilization of polymorphism with an abstract class.
- Creation and overriding of at least one abstract method.
- Application of the `protected` modifier at least 5 times.
- Method overriding for the methods `toString()`, `hashCode()`, and `equals()` for at least 3 classes within the hierarchy.

### Additional Features Implemented

The extended version of the homework has integrated the following elements:

- Introduction of interfaces to expand the functionality of the hierarchy.
- Incorporation of final classes, methods, and variables to restrict further inheritance or modification.
- Implementation of static blocks, methods, and variables to create class-level or shared functionalities.
