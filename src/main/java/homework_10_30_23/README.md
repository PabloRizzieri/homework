# Homework Readme

## Inheritance, Abstraction, Method Overriding, Class Object, Encapsulation (protected)

This homework builds upon the previous task, adding specific features and requirements to be implemented.

### Requirements

1. Implement polymorphism using at least one abstract class.
2. Create and override at least one abstract method.
3. Utilize the `protected` modifier at least 5 times.
4. Override methods from class Object (`toString()`, `hashCode()`, `equals()`) for at least 3 classes in the hierarchy.

### Previous Homework

The previous homework involved creating a class hierarchy with specific guidelines:

1. A hierarchy of at least 10 classes was required.
2. All classes needed to contain properties, with a minimum of 1 property each.
3. At least 5 private properties were to be distributed across the classes.
4. All private variables were mandated to have corresponding getters and setters.
5. Each class was to have at least one custom constructor.
6. A separate class with a `main()` method was to be created, instantiating objects of the implemented classes.

### Additional Features Implemented

This current iteration of the homework has added the following elements to the existing framework:

1. Incorporation of inheritance to establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.
2. Utilization of abstraction to define one or more abstract classes within the hierarchy.
3. Method overriding to redefine certain functionalities of the inherited methods.
4. Implementation of encapsulation using the `protected` modifier for specific variables.
